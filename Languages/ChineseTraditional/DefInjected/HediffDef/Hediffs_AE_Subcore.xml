        EN: Connection of subject and machine persona\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details the event which happened to Subject {PAWN_nameDef}. The subject is no longer human, as it's mind was overtaken by the subcore. This is seemingly a result of a mechanite infusion, which has seemingly infected the entire body, including the brain. Even if the person still looks like {PAWN_nameDef}, it's speaking the words of the subcore's persona. This infusion has also supposedly made the pawn highly agressive, as well as unkillable with conventional means. As a result of this observation, the anomaly associated with the subcore has been classified as Class-4 (Critical).\n\nHypothesis:\nBecause the connection could not have been established without the aid of mechanites, we suggest that the subject has came in contact with them at some point. Considering that this is the same person that has cleaned the subcore when we first discovered it, this is probably the moment when it all started. As the subpersona itself should not be capable of making the pawn so powerful, we assume that this device is nothing more than a tool of a higher mind, made for the sole purpose of tricking us for long enough for it to actually connect.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestroy: The obvious course of action, but considering it can't be damaged by any normal means, we would suggest using the unconventional ones, including the other anomalies.\nEscape: If the attempts to destroy the anomaly prove futile, escape seems to be the only thing we could do

	<Hediff_AE_SubcoreSecond.comps.HediffComp_Discoverable.discoverLetterText>對象與機械人格的連接\n\n對象：{PAWN_nameDef}\n\n摘要：\n本報告詳細記錄了發生在對象{PAWN_nameDef}身上的事件。由於其意識已被子核心佔，據該個體已不再是人類。這看起來是納米機械注入的結果，並且這種注入似乎已經感染了整個身體，包括大腦。雖然這個人看起來仍然像{PAWN_nameDef}，其所敘說的卻是人格子核的話語。這種注入也使得該個體變得極具攻擊性，並且無法用常規手段殺死。由於這一觀察結果，與人格子核相關的異常已被分類爲 4 級（緊急）異常。\n\n假說：\n由於連接的建立依賴於納米機械，我們推測與納米機械的接觸發生在之前的某個時刻。考慮到對象是在我們最初發現子核時對其進行清潔的人，也許在事情發生的最初連接就已建立。由於人格子核本身不應能使對象變得如此強大，我們假設這個裝置不過是更高級存在的工具，其唯一目的就是爲了欺騙我們足夠長的時間以實際建立連接。\n\n建議：\n摧毀：這是明顯的行動方案，但考慮到它不能被任何正常手段摧毀，我們建議使用非常規手段，包括使用其他異常。\n逃離：如果嘗試銷燬異常的努力證明是徒勞的，逃離似乎是我們唯一能做的事情。</Hediff_AE_SubcoreSecond.comps.HediffComp_Discoverable.discoverLetterText>
